# AI Project: "Mental Health Buddy" â€“ An Intelligent Support System

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Mental Health Buddy is an AI-powered support platform designed to help individuals manage stress, anxiety, and depression by providing real-time guidance, personalized resources, and emotional check-ins. Building AI course project.

## Background

Mental health issues affect millions globally, yet access to support is often limited due to stigma, cost, or lack of resources. My motivation comes from witnessing friends struggle with these challenges and seeing how technology could offer non-judgmental, accessible help. This project tackles:
* Lack of timely support for mental health concerns
* Difficulty in recognizing symptoms early
* Barriers to accessing professional help

## How is it used?

Users interact with Mental Health Buddy via a mobile app or web portal. They can:
* Chat with the AI for advice and emotional support
* Take mood and stress assessments
* Receive personalized coping strategies and mindfulness exercises
* Get reminders for self-care activities
* Access emergency contacts in crisis situations

The solution is needed in everyday life, especially during stressful events or when professional help is not immediately available. Users include students, working professionals, and anyone seeking mental well-being. Privacy and sensitivity are prioritized.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:
* Anonymized chat logs (consented users)
* Public mental health datasets ([WHO](https://www.who.int/data), [Kaggle Mental Health Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets))
* Self-reported mood tracking

AI methods:
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding user input and generating empathetic responses
* Sentiment analysis to detect emotional states
* Recommender systems for suggesting resources (articles, exercises)
* Predictive analytics for early warning of crisis

| Data Type         | Usage                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Chat Text         | Conversation, advice  |
| Mood Scores       | Personalization       |
| Resource Library  | Recommendations       |

## Challenges

* Does not replace professional diagnosis or therapy
* Limited by the quality of user input and available data
* Ethical concerns: privacy, data security, avoiding harmful advice
* Risk of over-reliance on AI for serious issues

## What next?

Future growth could include:
* Integration with wearable devices for passive mood tracking
* Multilingual support for wider accessibility
* Partnerships with mental health organizations
* Adding community support features
I would need expertise in app development, clinical psychology, and data security to move forward.
